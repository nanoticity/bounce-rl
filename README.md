# Bounce with Reinforcement Learning
This project is a adaptation of one of my projects for High Seas in order to let the computer learn how to do it, because I am sick and tired of being bad at the game.

## Learning
This code utilizes Reinforcement learning in which the computer forces the learner to keep playing the game and after every move it surveys, was this move good, bad, or neutral. This is the opening page of the website

## Trained
This demo shows what the code does after being fully trained previously so you don't have to wait like 30 minutes for the code to train fully.

## Playable
This is the base game that I submitted for High Seas, just so you can get a sense for what the computer is trying to learn.âˆ«
